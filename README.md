# Simple React Calculator 

This is a [simple react calculator](https://codepen.io/ariksasmita/pen/yqqzZW) copied from codepen. I am trying to see what I need to do in order to make this work in IE11 and IE10. 

## Initial Test 

The app itself works in Chrome. Edge looks good as well, but the buttons are little weird. It has the following problems in IE11. The errors are: 

- SCRIPT1003: Expected ':' 
- SCRIPT1002: Syntax error

I have no clue what these errors are but I am guessing that these are missing javascript features. Here are the initial screenshots:
